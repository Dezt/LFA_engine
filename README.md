# LFA_engine
This is a very lightweight C++ OpenGL wrapper and basic 2D game engine designed to be portable between Windows, OSX, Linux, and iOS.
It is the backbone of the games GunApp, 4P Air Battle, Guru Melon, and Pixation that were once published on iOS and designed for early versions of the iPhone and iPod Touch.   

The Engine was developed from 2009 until about 2012, and depends on SDL and the Hekkus Sound System by Thomas Maniero.  I don't have a license for Hekkus, so I can not post the source here, but if you can't obtain it, calls to Hekkus can probably be easily replaced to use a different library based on how the code is written.

This engine is probably still useful if you want to develop a very lightweight game for very low-end hardware that Unity or UE3 are too heavy for.
